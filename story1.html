                        <!-- <h3> Starting from Scratch</h3> -->

                        <p> If someone had told me two months ago that I would be able to build a website from scratch I
                            would have laughed them out of town.
                            As in hahaha to their face all the way to Kaabong. You see, I am of the analogue era and
                            technology generally intimidates me.
                            Or used to until very recently when out sheer curiosity and plenty of encouragement from my
                            friends I signed up for a course in Software Engineering.

                        </p>

                        <p> To say I was the most unlikely candidate for such a course would be the understatement of
                            the year.
                            My interaction with computers has always been limited to the MS office packages I learned
                            many years ago, emails and “googling” stuff, you know, the basics. That black screen with
                            its blinking cursor and unreadable words always gave me the heebie jeebies but yet when the
                            opportunity to apply for the catalyst course at Refactory came up I jumped at it.
                        </p>

                        <!-- <h3> Introduction to HTML & CSS </h3> -->

                        <p> Once I got accepted, I knew I was going to do everything I could to learn because I don’t do
                            half measure. And I’m learning, slower than I would have liked but learning all the same and
                            enjoying it.
                            I am not ‘of here’ any more! I KNOW STUFF. I know how the internet works, I know how content
                            gets to my screen every time I ‘Ask Google’ something. I know what’s happening in the
                            background as I look at a website or shop on-line.
                            Fascinating stuff I tell you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The first two weeks were about the basics of programming, downloading the tools we would
                            need and introductions to a whole bunch of things I had never heard of like GIT, HTML and
                            CSS.
                            All which was like greek to me when we started out but I have since grown comfortable enough
                            with them to build this website and I’m over the moon! I am constantly impressed by just how
                            much work goes into even the simplest tech.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What started out as a curiosity has turned into a hunger to discover more of this strange
                            universe I find myself in. It has become a rabbit hole of black screens, elements,
                            attributes and tags, the more I learn, the more I want to know.
                            This is the kind of self indulging I signed up for, so into the techverse I go…
